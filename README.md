# TELCO-CUSTOMER-CHURN-DATASET
An analysis of the Telco Customer Churn Dataset using Microsoft Excel with the intention of gaining insights on their services, contract analysis, and payment methods in relation to how it affects their churn rate(percentage of customers who leave the Telco company within a specific period). 
# Project Name: TELCO-CUSTOMER-CHURN-DATASET

# Data Transformation: The data was tranformed using Power Query Editor and visualised with Microsoft Excel.

# Findings and Recommendation: The following are my findings derived anazying the dataset:
1.  "Mailed Check" is the least preferred option for payment
2. The Telco Month-to-Month contract has the highest churn amount
3. 20% of their customers are senior citizens
4. Customers with the shortest tenure had a higher churn rate as compared to those with the longest tenure.
5. A great percentage of their customer bank is untapped due to the unavailability of INTERNET and PHONE SERVICE in their locations.
Based off this, my recommendations are:

Payment Options: Since "Mailed Check" is the least preferred payment option, it may be beneficial to focus on promoting and incentivizing alternative payment methods such as online payments, automatic bank transfers, or digital wallets. This can help streamline the payment process for customers and potentially reduce churn.

Month-to-Month Contract: Given that the Telco Month-to-Month contract has the highest churn amount, it might be worth investigating the reasons behind this trend. The Stakeholders should consider analyzing the contract terms, pricing, and customer satisfaction levels for customers on this contract. Identifying pain points and improving the overall customer experience for month-to-month customers may help reduce churn.

Senior Citizens: With 20% of the customers being senior citizens, it's essential to understand their specific needs and preferences. Consider conducting targeted marketing campaigns or offering tailored services that cater to this customer segment. Providing clear communication, personalized support, and simplified processes can help retain senior customers and reduce churn.

Tenure and Churn: The finding that customers with the shortest tenure have a higher churn rate compared to those with the longest tenure suggests the importance of building customer loyalty over time. Implementing customer retention strategies, such as loyalty programs, special offers, or personalized recommendations, can help increase customer engagement and reduce churn among new customers.

Untapped Customer Potential: If a significant percentage of the customer bank is untapped due to the unavailability of internet and phone service in certain locations, consider expanding the coverage area or exploring alternative connectivity solutions. This might involve investing in infrastructure development, partnering with other service providers, or offering alternative services like satellite internet or wireless connectivity options to reach those untapped customer segments.
