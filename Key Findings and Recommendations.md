1. **Payment Preferences:** The analysis revealed that "Mailed Check" is the least preferred payment option. To mitigate this, focusing on promoting and incentivizing alternative payment methods such as online payments, automatic bank transfers, or digital wallets could streamline the payment process, reducing churn.

2. **Contract Analysis:** The Telco Month-to-Month contract exhibited the highest churn amount. To address this, stakeholders should investigate the contract terms, pricing, and customer satisfaction levels, aiming to improve the overall customer experience and subsequently reduce churn.

3. **Senior Citizen Segment:** With 20% of customers being senior citizens, tailoring marketing campaigns and services to meet their specific needs is crucial. Clear communication, personalized support, and simplified processes can help retain senior customers and mitigate churn.

4. **Tenure and Churn:** Customers with shorter tenures demonstrated a higher churn rate than those with longer tenures. This emphasizes the importance of building customer loyalty over time. Implementing customer retention strategies, like loyalty programs, special offers, or personalized recommendations, can boost engagement and reduce churn among new customers.

5. **Untapped Customer Potential:** The presence of untapped customer potential due to limited internet and phone service availability suggests exploring coverage area expansion or alternative connectivity solutions. This could involve investing in infrastructure development, partnering with other service providers, or offering satellite internet and wireless connectivity options to reach untapped customer segments.
